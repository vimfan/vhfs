Virtual Hybrid File System

Research project which main aim is to create an implementation of some
conception for virtual and partially hierarchical - partially semantic
filesystem. 

Quick introduction in question - answer pairs.

*Question*: 
Why it's hybrid?

*Answer*: 
Because it synthesizes some concepts of semantic and hierarchical
filesystems. It uses tags, but we assume that tags may be organized in
hierarchies so they build tree.


*Question*: 
Why it's virtual?

*Answer*: 
Beacause it doesn't take care of storing files. Files are stored in
"traditional" filesystems, and VHFS keeps only symbolic links to them.


*Question*:
Why it's a filesystem?

*Answer*:
Filesystem interface is used by all legacy applications. Good thing would be to
get some new possibilities for organizing data and give them legacy
applications. 

Examples:

From now on we're assuming that /vhfs is an mountpoint of our virtual
filesystem. Note that we don't store any files, just links to them. 

* USE CASES

    Searching files using ls utility

    * with tags concept:

    $ ls -al /vhfs/@music/@jazz/not@rock
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 11 2009-11-18 00:58 urbaniak.i34.mp3 -> /home/user/music/urbaniak.mp3
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 11 2009-11-18 00:58 jerzy_milan.i45.mp3 -> /home/user/music/jerzy_milan.mp3

    $ ls -al /vhfs/not@rock/@jazz/@music
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 11 2009-11-18 00:58 urbaniak.i34.mp3 -> /home/user/music/urbaniak.mp3
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 11 2009-11-18 00:58 jerzy_milan.i45.mp3 -> /home/user/music/jerzy_milan.mp3

    (Please note: output is identical in both cases(!) despite we've change 
    order of path parts)

    * using Attributes:

    $ ls -al /vhfs/@bitrate < 192/@year < 2000/@modification < 2009-01-03
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 11 2009-11-18 00:58 miles_davis.i1.mp3 -> /tmp/Miles Davis.mp3

    $ ls -al /vhfs/@modification < 2009-01-03/@year < 2000/@bitrate < 192
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 11 2009-11-18 00:58 miles_davis.i1.mp3 -> /tmp/Miles Davis.mp3

    (Order of path parts again doesn't matter - outpus it the same)
